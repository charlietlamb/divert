    question: "What size companies do you work with?",
    answer: `We have helped scale startups from 0 and 7 figure ecom stores to multi 7 figures.
We do prefer working with founders who have a good understanding of advertising as you will be driving your own traffic. 
Easiest way to find out if your business is eligible, is to book a call.
Regardless of outcome, we will still provide you with actionable insights to increase your CVR and AOV.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know this will work for me?",
    answer: `You Don't.
Neither do we.
But if you are an ecom company with a low CVR and a low AOV, then lets have a call and see if we can help. If we don’t think we can help then we go our separate ways, if we do think we can help, we fix your low conversions and AOV issues for good.
(seems like a fair deal to me)`,
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your payment structure?",
    answer: `You pay us once.
We don’t want to take your money, month after month on a retainer.
This is important to you because it means you don’t have to continuously pay out of pocket after your onboarding and it’s important to us because it allows us to pay our elite team of CRO experts what they need to produce exceptional results.
(which makes us look better)`,

  {
    question: "What happens if we don’t lower your cost per acquisition?",
    answer: `We work with you for no charge until it does, or refund you.`,

    question: "What happens if we don’t increase your conversion rate?",
    answer: `We work with you for no charge until it does, or refund you.`,
