      I learnt how to build websites from a young age and decided to start
      working as a freelancer. During this time I built over 25 websites, both
      B2B & B2C. After 6 months, as a freelancer I realised the key was to build
      sites that not only look great, but also convert.

      After developing my web development skills, I got a position as Web
      Developer & CRO specialist in a successful marketing company. Building out
      websites, landing pages and funnels for ecommerce clients running paid
      traffic through Facebook. During my time here I worked closely with the
      CEO and gained a real insight not only on the CRO side but also with
      online advertising, specifically Facebook. This was the perfect
      springboard for me to start my own agency.

      <br />
      After accruing the suitable marketing experience the next logical step for
      me was to start my own CRO Agency. To begin with, we focused on paid
      traffic and CRO before honing in on solely Conversion Rate Optimisation.
      With 5 members of staff and counting we are currently working with a
      number of e-commerce companies, helping them to increase their CVR and AOV
      at scale. We would love to have a 30-minute consultation with you guys to
      discuss how we can help you do the same.
