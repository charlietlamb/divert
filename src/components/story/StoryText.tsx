      I learnt how to build websites from a young age and decided to start
      working as a freelancer. During this time I built over 25 websites, both
      B2B & B2C. After 6 months, as a freelancer I worked with an ecommerce
      client who had a very unique colour scheme. Pink and Yellow. Not the first
      pairing that springs to mind but to be fair, the site looked brilliant.
      Many of their customers commented on the website’s aesthetics and I even
      ended up getting a handful of referrals.

      <br />
      The problem was the site’s CVR was not high enough to be able to scale.
      The key is to build sites that not only look great, but ACTUALLY convert.
      As a result, I got a position as Web Developer & CRO specialist in a very
      successful marketing company so I could accrue the skills needed to
      consistently build sites that convert at scale. During which, I worked
      closely with the CEO and gained real insight, not only on the CRO side,
      but also with online advertising, specifically Facebook.
      <br />
      <br />
      After mastering these skills the next logical step was to start my own CRO
      Agency. To begin with, we focused on paid traffic and CRO before honing in
      on solely Conversion Rate Optimisation. With 5 members of staff and
      counting we are currently working with a number of e-commerce companies,
      helping them to increase their CVR and AOV at scale. We would love to have
      a 30-minute consultation with you guys to discuss how we can help you do
      the same.
